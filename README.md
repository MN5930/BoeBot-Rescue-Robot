The goal for this assignment is to equip the robot with behaviors which allows it to roam a disaster area and identify victims in need of rescue, and then move them into a specific area.
In practice, the robot will be placed in an irregularly shaped arena, with a light colored floor. The surrouding walls (30 cm high) are uncurved. Within the arena, a number of metal cylinders (symbolizing victims) are scattered about. The cylinders are made of blank aluminium and are about 6 cm high with a diameter of about 7 cm. Also, within the arena is the safe zone, a square shaped area (about 50x50 cm) made of black paper taped to the floor. Furthermore, an IR beacon, about 10.5 cm high, is positioned in the middle of the safe zone. The beacon can be used by the robot in order to find the safe zone. However, the irregularities of the arena might produce spots where the beacon is hidden to the robot. The task is to find as many victims as possible and bring them to the safe zone.
